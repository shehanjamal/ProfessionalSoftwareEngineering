Yes we can add a class but it cannot be added under the Person class because it does not have a relationship 
the parent class. When adding a class under the parent we have to check whether 
it can have parent child relationship as we can see class cannot have a preant child relationship with person so due to 
this it cannot be added as child class. It can be added as a separate class.
